### deployment

Super easy to run this stack. Just deploy all secrets first

```bash
kc apply -f ~/Source/infra-secrets/digitalocean -R
```

Then deploy the stack onto any DO managed k8s cluster. Make sure the nginx ingress is installed from their one-click store.

Additionally ensure cert-manager is installed from [these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nginx-ingress-with-cert-manager-on-digitalocean-kubernetes#step-2-â€”-setting-up-the-kubernetes-nginx-ingress-controller) from Digital Ocean.

```bash
kc apply -f ~/Source/infra/digitalocean -R
```

## 212

The host at 212 runs a single node portainer instance as Docker Swarm. It's entirely manual because of the dependancy that all containers running on-premise require filesystem access, and most of them require access to the NAS where media content is hosted.
