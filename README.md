# infra

## dns

Managed by [Cloudflare Zero Trust](https://cloudflare.com).

## 212

The host at 212 runs a single node portainer instance as Docker Swarm. It's entirely manual because of the dependancy that all containers running on-premise require filesystem access, and most of them require access to the NAS where media content is hosted.

## history

I use this infra panel to test and explore new self-hosted services, SaaS products, and historically my own kubernetes cluster. Please explore the history of this repo for a more detailed history of my personal infrastructure projects.
